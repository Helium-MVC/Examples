	 * The file should only contain the database configuration. Please not that you can

	 * dbhost - The host or ip the database is on
	 * dbuser - The username to connected to the database
	 * dbpass - The password the user uses to connect to the database
	 * dbtype - The type of database. Options are mysql - postgresql - mssql- mongo
	 * dbname - The name of the database on the host
	 * dbport - Optional. The port that is used to connect to the database
	 * dbschema - Optional. The schema the database is on (generally used in PostgreSQL)
	 * dbprefix - Optional. A prefix that will be placed in front of every table.
	 * 
	 * Sample
	 * 
	 * $connections['connection_1']['dbhost']='xxx.xxxx.xxx';
	 * $connections['connection_1']['dbuser']='auser';
	 * $connections['connection_1']['dbpass']='apassword';
